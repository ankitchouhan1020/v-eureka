          <li>The rules are pretty much the same for those who have played the previous editions of Klueless. But there are a few more things we have added that we feel might have been missed out on earlier occasions. Hence, irrespective of whether you are a Klueless veteran or a new player, we request that you kindly take a moment to read the wall of text that follows...</li>
          <li>The first rule of Klueless is you do NOT talk about Klueless...</li>
          <li>Naah, just kidding! We most definitely want you to recommend it to those around you. The actual bit starts from here...</li>
          <li>The game play involves getting to the next level by whatever means necessary.</li>
          <li>There are mainly 3 ways by which you can get across levels</li>
          <ul><li>Entering the answer in the text box</li>
            <li>Changing the URL in the address bar</li>
            <li>Clicking on various objects on the page</li></ul>
          <li>Answers are not case sensitive. In case the answer contains more than one word, do not forget to include spaces. We try to cover most possible answers to a level, but do try out different combinations of answers if we might have missed some out (we're human after all). Answers with multiple words will contain a space between them, so do take care of the same</li>
